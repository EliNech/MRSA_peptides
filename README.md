# Description
## Problem
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen forming clusters of cocci that can also be found on multiple
parts of healthy people, such as the skin and nose. It causes a variety of infections, abscesses, impetigo, pneumonia, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome and sepsis.

There is a variety of Staphylococcus aureus that is difficult to treat because it is resistant to some antibiotics.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is listed as a high-priority pathogen because its infection is associated with a high mortality rate. 
The search for new antibiotics to treat MRSA is prioritized as highly urgent by the World Health Organization.

## Solution
Because antimicrobial peptides have captured attention as novel drug candidates due to their rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, anti-MRSA peptides have emerged as potential therapeutics
for the treatment of bacterial infections. The aim of this project is to develop a ML model capable of predicting the activity of antimicrobial peptides against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 
In the future, the model will be improved: it will be possible to predict the activity of peptides against a variety of bacteria, not just Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA.


## Database
Data taken from the Antimicrobial Peptide Data Repository (DRAMP, http://dram.cpu-bioinfor.org/).
In addition, the data were supplemented with MRSA peptides from the articles. 
Descriptors for peptides have been previously calculated.
