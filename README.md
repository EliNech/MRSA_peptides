# Description
## Problem
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen forming clusters of cocci that can also be found on multiple
parts of healthy people, such as the skin and nose. It causes a variety of infections, abscesses, impetigo, pneumonia, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome and sepsis.

There is a variety of Staphylococcus aureus that is difficult to treat because it is resistant to some antibiotics.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is listed as a high-priority pathogen because its infection is associated with a high mortality rate. 
The search for new antibiotics to treat MRSA is prioritized as highly urgent by the World Health Organization.

Bacterial infections caused by intracellular pathogens are difficult to control. Conventional antibiotic therapies are often ineffective, as high doses are needed to increase the number of antibiotics that will cross the host cell membrane to act on the intracellular bacterium.
Antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides  have shown great potential to treat such infections by acting directly on the intracellular pathogenic bacterium or performing the delivery of cargos with antibacterial activities. 
So, an important task is to find new drugs â€” peptides against bacterial infections with high mortality. However, drug development is a very long process, sometimes taking up to 10 years. The use of machine learning methods to discover new drugs can speed up this process. 


## Solution
Because antimicrobial peptides have captured attention as novel drug candidates due to their rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, anti-MRSA peptides have emerged as potential therapeutics
for the treatment of bacterial infections. The aim of this project is to develop a ML model capable of predicting the activity of antimicrobial peptides against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). 
In the future, the model will be improved: it will be possible to predict the activity of peptides against a variety of bacteria, not just Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA.


## Database
Data taken from the Antimicrobial Peptide Data Repository (DRAMP, http://dram.cpu-bioinfor.org/).
In addition, the data were supplemented with MRSA peptides from the articles. 
Descriptors for peptides have been previously calculated.
